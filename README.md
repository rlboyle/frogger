Inspired by the classic arcade game frogger, the player controls the frog using the pushbuttons and accumulates points by moving forward.

Advanced Features 
Sound: Intro music, sound when frog moves, frog dies, powerup collected, and level completed 
Massive number of active and discernable sprites: 1 frog, 1 moving text sprite, 3 powerups, 21 cars
Complex scoring system: Increment score by ten when frog moves forward, moving backwards and forwards again does not count. Points only accumulate when the frog moves to a previously unreached y-coordinate.
  Powerup #1 (pink square) adds one life when collected
  Powerup #2 (yellow square) adds 100 points when collected
  Evil powerup (red square) subtracts 100 points when hit.

Controls
Button #0: Move frog right
Button #1: Move frog left
Button #2: Move frog down
Button #3: Move frog up
Note: Buttons must be unchecked before use. Unchecking a checked button will not move the frog. The frog can only be moved by checking an unchecked button.
